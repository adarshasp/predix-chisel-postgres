# predix-chisel-postgres

This Cloud Foundry application allows you to connect to "internal" only services, specifically the Postgres service, but can be extended to others as well.

Pre-built chisel (See  https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) binaries are included.

There are 3 binaries included (Linux/OS X/Windows) which can be used as the server or client depending on arguments supplied.

The codebase has an additional client flag for a proxy to be specified in case you are behind a corporate firewall.

This method can be used to expose ANY service isolated by the predix.io environment (RabbitMQ/Logstash/etc).

No security mechanisms are bypassed - everything is still over SSL, and credentials must be passed by your connecting client.

Source code for the client that includes the proxy code can be built by cloning https://github.com/chromicant/chisel/tree/proxy
If you are not behind a proxy, you can use the binary releases from the main chisel repo.

## Setup

Assuming you have no existing postgres instance in predix.io, you can create, deploy, and bind this application like this:

```
#create predix postgres instance
cf create-service <postgres-db-service-name> <my-db-plan> <my-db-name>
#for example : cf create-service postgres shared-nr postgres-chisel

#clone repo & deploy the app
git clone https://github.com/briangann/predix-chisel-postgres.git
cd predix-chisel-postgres/app/
cf push --no-start

#start and bind chisel service to your existing Postgres database instance
cf start predix-chisel-postgres
cf bind-service <postgres-db-service-name> <my-db-name>
#for example : cf bind-service predix-chisel-postgres postgres-chisel
cf restage predix-chisel-postgres
```

## NOTE
On Mac OSX, you may need to "unset" an environment variable to run the client (if you have Digital Guardian installed). The binary is a golang compile, and throws an exception with DG.

Run this in the shell before launching the client:
```
export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=""
```

## Connecting the client (the easy way)

Inside the bin folder, there is a script for connecting to your chisel server, invoking psql/mysql automatically. It will also detect if you have "https_proxy" set
and pass the appropriate argument.

On MacOS, you can use homebrew to install dependencies "jq" and "psqlodbc"

```
brew install psqlodbc
brew install jq
```

Highly recommend using "cf-traveling-admin" from https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/traveling-cf-admin

```
./bin/client_connect.sh APP_NAME
```

Here's an example:

## Connecting the client manually

Use CF to get the URI of the deployed application bound to your postgres service instance. You will also need to get the IP address of the postgres server you are bound to.

```
cf env predix-chisel-postgres

{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "postgres": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "database": "mydatabaseinstance",
     "host": "10.72.6.139",
     "password": "mysecretpassword",
     "port": "5432",
     "username": "myusername"
    },
   },
```

Get the URI to your application from the VCAP_APPLICATION section:
```
{
 "VCAP_APPLICATION": {
  "application_uris": [
   "predix-chisel-postgres-nonsecretive-bioastronautics.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io"
  ],
 }
}
```

```
cf env predix-chisel-postgres
```
Run the client on your local machine, here are examples:

NO PROXY
```

Start client on OS X, locally bound to port 4000:

./chisel_darwin_amd64 client -v --keepalive 3s https://predix-chisel-postgres-nonsecretive-bioastronautics.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io 4000:10.72.6.139:5432

Start client on Linux locally bound to port 4000:

./chisel_linux_amd64 client -v --keepalive 3s https://predix-chisel-postgres-nonsecretive-bioastronautics.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io 5000:10.72.6.139:5432
```

WITH PROXY
```
./chisel_darwin_amd64 client -v --proxy https://mycorporateproxy.foo.com:80 --keepalive 3s https://predix-chisel-postgres-nonsecretive-bioastronautics.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io 4000:10.72.6.139:5432
```


WITH ALIAS
```
nano ~/.bash_profile
alias tunnelservice='~/predix-chisel-postgres/app/code/chisel-bin/chisel_darwin_amd64 client -v --proxy https://mycorporateproxy.foo.com:80 --keepalive 3s https://predix-chisel-postgres-nonsecretive-bioastronautics.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io 4000:10.72.6.139:5432
source ~/.bash_profile
tunnelservice
```

## Connecting the client as a background service
WITH SUPERVISORD - Running service perpetually on the background or Persistent connection to the DB (http://supervisord.org/)
1. Make sure you have Homebrew installed: /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
2. Use Homebrew to install supervisord: brew install supervisord and brew services start supervisord will enable it to run at boot
3. Clone the chisel client somewhere: git clone https://github.com/briangann/predix-chisel-postgres.git
4. Copy the initial supervisor config file to make changes: cp /usr/local/etc/supervisord.ini /usr/local/etc/supervisord.conf
5. Add this entry to your supervisord.conf file:
```
[program:frameview]
command=~/predix-chisel-postgres/app/code/chisel-bin/chisel_darwin_amd64 client -v --proxy https://mycorporateproxy.foo.com:80 --keepalive 3s https://predix-chisel-postgres-nonsecretive-bioastronautics.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io 4000:10.72.6.139:5432
autorestart=true
```

Use any postgres client (SQuirreL, Postico, etc).

You will connect to your local machine, which will forward to the predix application.

Example for Postico:

* host: localhost
* port: 4000
* user: username from VCAP_SERVICES
* password: password from VCAP_SERVICES
* database: database name from VCAP_SERVICES
Sample
./chisel_windows_386 client -v --proxy http://proxy:port --keepalive 3s https://chiselurl 4001:10.80.14.169:5432
